## 🚀 About LoungeF2X
LoungeF2X is a small unblocked games website I am making so I can have fun in school so most of the links are hosted by Replit. I am work on adding new games and making it use vercel links as anything in iframes are unblocked on most of the school blockers. I have tested it on GoGuardian and Securly but from what I have seen it works on any. Join our discord to suggest games / report bugs / or just chat with the Community!
## 🚀 Selfhosting

Download the [repo](https://github.com/LoungeF2X/LoungeF2X.git). If you are using Visual Studio Code use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin then right click index.html and click “Open with Live” and there you go! You now have a working version of LoungeF2X. However if you are using any hosting service import the repo and use the built in running feature.
